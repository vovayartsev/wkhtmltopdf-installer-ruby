Downloads and installs wkhtmltopdf from the official website

** This is Avant's fork to use version 0.12.2.1.3 with the new downloads provider **

## Usage

```bash
  gem install wkhtmltopdf-installer
```

Then in your Ruby script

```ruby
  require 'wkhtmltopdf_installer'
  system WkhtmltopdfInstaller.wkhtmltopdf_path

  # this also works, because ENV['PATH'] is adjusted
  system 'wkhtmltopdf'
```

The gem also provides a shim, so that it works in the shell too.
